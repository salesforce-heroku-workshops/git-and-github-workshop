# A beginners guide to Git and Github

This is a step by step guide to getting going with Git, the distributed version control system.

The workshop is deployed on Heroku at: [http://git-and-github-workshop.herokuapp.com/](http://git-and-github-workshop.herokuapp.com/).

This guide covers the essential features so you can start to use Git to manage your changes in a local repository and then moves on to Github so you can share your managed code with the outside world.

* git command line / graphical tool set up on your laptop
* understanding staging, committing and pushing changes
* working with git status and git log to manage changes
* experience using github for new repos as well as forking & cloning
* managing multiple repositories easily with git log
* working with pull request

This workshop is focused on using git as a developer and will not be diving under the covers of git, or covering any implementation details.
